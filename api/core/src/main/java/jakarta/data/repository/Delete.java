/**
 * <p>Annotates a repository method to perform delete operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@code Delete} annotation indicates that the annotated repository method requests one or more
 * entities to be removed from the database. To request deletion of specific entity instances, the annotated
 * repository method must have a single parameter whose type must be one of the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The entity to be deleted.</li>
 *     <li>An {@code Iterable} of entities to be deleted.</li>
 *     <li>An array of entities to be deleted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The {@code Delete} annotation can be used on a repository method that has no parameters
 * to request deletion of all entity instances of the primary entity type.</p>
 * <p>The return type of the annotated method must be {@code void}, {@code boolean}, {@code int}, {@code long},
 * or a corresponding primitive wrapper such as {@link Integer}.
 * A boolean return type indicates whether or not an entity was deleted from the database.
 * An {@code int} or {@code long} return type indicates how many entities were deleted from the database.
 * </p>
 * <p>Deletion of a given entity is performed by matching the entity's Id. If the entity is versioned (e.g.,
 * with {@code jakarta.persistence.Version}), the version is also checked for consistency during deletion.
 * Properties other than the Id and version do not need to match for deletion.
 * </p>
 * <p>For example, consider an interface representing a garage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * interface Garage {
 *     {@code @Delete}
 *     void unpark(Car car);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>If this annotation is combined with other operation annotations (e.g.,
 * {@code @Find}, {@code @Insert}, {@code @Query}, {@code @Update},
 * {@code @Save}), it will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} as only one operation type can be specified.</p>
 * <p>If the unique identifier of a requested entity is not found in the database or its version does not match, and the return
 * type of the annotated method is {@code void} or {@code Void}, the method must
 * raise {@link jakarta.data.exceptions.OptimisticLockingFailureException}.
