/**
 * <p>Annotates a repository method that updates entities if found in the database
 * and inserts entities into the database that are not found.
 * This method must have a single parameter whose type must be one of the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The entity to be saved.</li>
 *     <li>An {@code Iterable} of entities to be saved.</li>
 *     <li>An array of entities to be saved.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The return type of an annotated method that requires a single entity as the parameter
 * must have a return type that is {@code void}, {@code Void}, or the same type as the parameter.
 * The return type of an annotated method that accepts an {@code Iterable} or array of entities
  * as the parameter must have a return type that is {@code void}, {@code Void},
  * or an {@code Iterable} or array of the entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>Saving an entity involves persisting it in the database. If the entity has an ID or key that already exists
 * in the database, the method will update the existing record. If the entity does not exist in the database or has a
 * null ID, this method will insert a new record. The entity instance returned by this method will be updated with
 * any automatically generated or incremented values that changed due to the save operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>Entities that are returned by the annotated method must include all values that were
 * written to the database, including all automatically generated values and incremented values
 * that changed due to the save. The position of entities within an {@code Iterable} or array return value
 * must correspond to the position of entities in the parameter based on the unique identifier of the entity.</p>
 * <p>After invoking this method, avoid using the entity value that was supplied as a parameter, because it might not accurately
 * reflect the changes made during the save process. If the entity uses optimistic locking and its version differs from
 * the version in the database, an {@link jakarta.data.exceptions.OptimisticLockingFailureException} will be thrown.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>For example, consider an interface representing a garage:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Repository}
 * interface Garage {
 *     {@code @Save}
 *     Car park(Car car);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>The {@code @Save} annotation can be used to indicate that the {@code park(Car)} method is responsible
 * for updating the entity in the database if it already exists there and otherwise inserting
 * a car entity into a database.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>If this annotation is combined with other operation annotations (e.g., {@code @Update}, {@code @Delete},
 * {@code @Find}, {@code @Insert}, {@code @Query}),
 * it will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} because only one operation type can be specified.
 * A Jakarta Data provider implementation must detect (and report) this error at compile time or at runtime.</p>
 * @see jakarta.data.exceptions.OptimisticLockingFailureException
